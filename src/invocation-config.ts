/**
 * The model-facing `isolation` parameter, shared by the `Agent` tool and the
 * nested delegation tool so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Shape matters more than wording here. As a single-value optional literal,
 * models that fill every optional parameter — the transcript on #231 shows one
 * emitting `resume: ""`, `schedule: ""` and `model: "default"` alongside it —
 * had only `"worktree"` available to fill it with, and kept spawning worktrees
 * across three turns while their own reasoning said to omit the field. Every
 * other optional parameter has an inert filler; this one did not. `"off"` is
 * listed first and described as the default so the harmless value is the
 * obvious one to reach for.
 *
 * The wording tracks Claude Code's own `isolation` parameter, whose phrasing
 * models have the most exposure to: one description on the union rather than
 * per-value ones, opening "Isolation mode.", then a sentence per value in
 * schema order, each with its caveats in a trailing parenthetical. Two clauses
 * are ours, because our shape is not theirs — `"off"` has no counterpart there
 * (their enum is `worktree | remote`, so both of their values do something),
 * and neither does the uncommitted-work warning, which is the specific trap
 * #231 fell into. Deliberately absent is any "only use a worktree when…"
 * restriction: Claude Code's `Agent` tool states the capability and stops, and
 * a second legal value is what lets a model decline one, not being told to.

 * for a project whose model passes `"worktree"` on *every* call, so a
 * per-result "isolation was disabled" note would be noise on every result and
 * would keep raising the salience of a capability that isn't there. With no
 * field there is nothing to pass, nothing to drop, and nothing to explain — the
 * same trade `scheduleParam` makes for disabled scheduling, at zero LLM-context
 * cost. The resolver gate and the `agent-manager` check still cover the paths a
 * schema can't reach: agent files, the scheduler, and cross-extension RPC.
 *
 * Like `scheduleParam`, this is read once at tool registration — flipping the
 * setting needs a new pi session for the schema to change.
