/**
 * agent-runner-e2e.test.ts — End-to-end test against the REAL pi-mono runtime.
 *
 * Every other agent-runner test mocks `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`: it
 * asserts that `runAgent` hands the right `tools:` allowlist to a *simulated*
 * `createAgentSession`. That proves our allowlist math, but not the assumption
 * the math rests on — that real pi-mono actually gates a session to that
 * allowlist, admitting extension-registered tools (the #47 fix) and dropping
 * the rest.
 *
 * This test closes that loop with NO pi-mono mock:
 *   - a real extension fixture (`fixtures/e2e-probe-ext.mjs`) registers a tool,
 *   - the real `DefaultResourceLoader` loads it via `additionalExtensionPaths`,
 *   - the real `createAgentSession` builds the session,
 *   - we read the real `session.getActiveToolNames()` at `onSessionCreated`
 *     (fires after construction, before any prompt) and assert what the LLM
 *     would actually be allowed to call.
 *
 * No network/LLM: a faux Model object satisfies `createAgentSession`'s `model`
 * param, and we never depend on a turn completing — the assertion is on the
 * gated tool set, which is fixed at construction. (Driving a live faux model
 * through `session.prompt()` is intentionally avoided: under Vite the faux
 * provider registers in a different `pi-ai` module instance than the one
 * pi-coding-agent streams through, which is brittle and orthogonal to gating.)
